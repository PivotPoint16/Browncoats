PivotPoint 2016 Notes

how you can help public housing
- Shrinking pool of potential housing options because of renter-
heavy market
- public housing infrastructure does not age well
- utilities for public housing is expensive and it is a big game
of telephone
- very large population of homeless people and they are hard to
keep track of. 
- Processes are done mostly on paper due to outdated technology. 
Difficult for tenants to get access to internet. 
- Pre-paid phones are usually outdated. 

Ideas
- an app that runs on Android 4.0 minimum that gives tenants access
to necessary data and make the public housing rental process
easier. 
- plot funding data and housing complaints data onto map using 
Google Maps api (just Hartford CT)
- plot funding data and homelessness data onto map using Google
Maps api (whole country)

Plan
- Design a system that cross references Community Development Block Grant Data
with Homelessness Data to detect potential fraudulent activity by organizations
that receive federal loans/grants/subsidies. 
- Data needed: 
	- Community Development Block Grant Data
	- Homelessness Data
- Steps: 
	1. Get the Google Maps API up and running
	2. Develop Android app that implements the Maps API
		- How to shade maps based on trends
		- How to overlay other GUI elements (tabs, menus)
		- How to cross-comm between R and Java
	3. Plug in the data
	
Testing the Maps API with Housing Code Violation Data
- Need ViolationRecordParser, ViolationRecord
- VR uses LatLng to store coordinates
- MapsActivity uses VRP to populate map by getting location data
